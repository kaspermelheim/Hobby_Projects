                        Computers can make our jobs become easier. 
                        They can be used for communicational purposes (internet), to store and calculate data and to write up massive documents multiple times while only needing to write it up once.<br><br>
                        Others use computers for entertainment value; to play games, watch movies and play music etc.
                        Computers are also more convinient and reliable than the older ways of doing things, like type writers, scales and other counting devices.<br><br>

                <p>Programmers use programming languages to communicate with computers. 
                    Many different languages exist, and each one has its own unique features, though they all share some similarities. 
                    Because each language is different, each may be best suited for a certain purpose or purposes within certain industries.<br><br>
                    Some programming languages are used to create programs to solve problems or interpret data. Other programming languages are more suitable for making create software or apps that entertain. With a strong need for unique and diverse programming languages, it is virtually impossible to create a single universal programming language that meets all needs. 
                    <br><br>Programming languages are often revised and even combined with other languages over time, evolving to meet our changing technological needs.</p><br>
